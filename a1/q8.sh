#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Write a shell script that accepts a file name as an input and performs the following activities
# on the given file. The program asks for a string of characters (that is, any word) to be provided
# by the user. The file will be searched to find whether it contains the given word. If the file
# contains the given word, the program will display (a) the number of occurrences of the word.
# The program is also required to display (b) the line number in which the word has occurred.
# (Note: the word may occur more than once in a given line) If the file does not contain the
# word, an appropriate error message will be displayed.
